Summary:

Machine learning is the science and engineering of enabling computers to learn from data, adapt, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention. It is a rapidly evolving field with deep theoretical roots and a wide range of practical applications, fundamentally transforming how technology interacts with the world.


2.3.	  Neural Networks and Deep Learning:

Neural networks and deep learning are interconnected fields within artificial intelligence (AI) that enable machines to learn complex patterns from data. Neural networks, inspired by biological neurons, form the foundation of deep learning, which leverages multi-layered architectures to solve advanced problems in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.

Neural Networks:

A neural network is a machine learning model composed of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) organized into layers:
1.	Input layer: Receives raw data (e.g., pixels from an image).
2.	Hidden layers: Process data through weighted connections and activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).
3.	Output layer: Produces final predictions or classifications.

Key mechanisms:

1.	Training: Adjusts weights and biases using labelled data to minimize errors via backpropagation and optimization techniques like gradient descent.
2.	Activation functions: Determine whether a neuron “fire” based on input signals (e.g., σ(z)=11+e−zσ(z)=1+e−z1).

Types of neural networks:

Type	Use Case
Feedforward (MLP)	Basic pattern recognition (e.g., spam detection).
Convolutional (CNN)	Image and video analysis via filters and pooling layers.
Recurrent (RNN)	Sequential data (e.g., time-series forecasting, text generation).

Deep Learning:

Deep learning refers to neural networks with three or more hidden layers, enabling hierarchical feature extraction from large datasets. Key characteristics:
1.	Complexity: Deep architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) can model intricate relationships in data, such as detecting edges in images or contextual meaning in text.

Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) method that teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain. Deep learning models can recognize complex pictures, text, sounds, and other data patterns to produce accurate insights and predictions. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain, and they can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
Deep learning works by using artificial neural networks to learn from data. Neural networks are made up of layers of interconnected nodes, and each node is responsible for learning a specific feature of the data.  Building on our previous example with images – in an image recognition network, the first layer of nodes might learn to identify edges, the second layer might learn to identify shapes, and the third layer might learn to identify objects.
As the network learns, the weights on the connections between the nodes are adjusted so that the network can better classify the data. This process is called training, and it can be done using a variety of techniques, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
